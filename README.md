# Eastern Players Concert Ticket Website

###### Eastern Players Concert Ticket Website is my HTML & CSS 2.0 Capstone Project at Microverse. This project is a complete design on the Eastern Players Concert Tickets (Fictional). It follows a design prototype from Cindy Shin CC Global Summit 2015.

###### Complete design of the index, about, and ticket pages were designed using Grid, Flexbox, Bootstrap, alongside other CSS concepts covered in the HTML/CSS 2.0 module. Thus, I have used HTML 5 semantic tags, CSS styling, and bootstrap in this project.
