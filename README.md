# Eastern Players Concert Ticket Website

This project is my HTML & CSS 2.0 Capstone Project in Microverse.

The project is a complete design on the Eastern Players Concert Tickets (Fictional). It follows a design prototype from Cindy Shin CC Global Summit 2015.

Complete design of the index, about and ticket page designed using Grid, Flexbox, Bootstrap, alongside with other CSS concepts.

In this project, HTML, CSS styling and bootstrap 4 was used.

Due to some unexpected health challenges, I could not strictly follow through the challenge breakdown. Hence, I had to skip some steps.

I used the CSS checkbox trick to implement the mobile menu.
